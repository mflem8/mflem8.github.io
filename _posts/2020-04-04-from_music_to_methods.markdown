I've always had a natural inclination towards and interest in tech. I remember when we got our first PC, I used to set my alarm clock for 5:00am on school days just so I could get up and use the computer first thing in the morning. I am typically the guy people call when they have tech problems, be it hardware, software, website, etc. I can remember many times in school my parents would remark at how gifted I seemed to be with computers and that I should consider a career with them. Well, this was not anything I wanted to hear because for the first 20 years of my life I was convinced I was going to be a rock star. Computers? Who needs them. Math? Won't need that on a tour bus.

These dreams served me well for a long time. I have lived on a tour bus, played shows and festivals all over the country, and then once I was tired of the road life I moved to Nashville, TN where I was a tour/concert booking agent for 5 years. I continue to do music full-time to this day, as I am on staff at a local church as the Director of Worship. 

In my current role, in addition to music, I also handle our graphic design. When I got into the job I realized how desparately they needed a good designer and I took on the task of learning. As my role has evolved I have also been involved with the app and website. This sparked my interest in coding and I have spent the last couple years self-teaching myself some basics of HTML, CSS, Python, and Javascript. As I did, that's when I began to realize there's this place in time and space where really great design and really great code meet. And when they meet they create something amazing. It's what drives my passion to get up every day and code. 

And that is why I want to study software engineering.
