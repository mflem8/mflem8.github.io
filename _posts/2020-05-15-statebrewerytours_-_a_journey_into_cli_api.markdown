Well here we are, the end of my first project week(s) with the Flatiron School. This was a challenging project for me; not necessarily because the code was overly complex, but because it was my first experience coding with no spec file to run my code against. As a new developer, I feel I have become fairly adept at reading failed tests and modifying code accordingly to pass the test. The notion of starting a blank page, conceptualizing a brand new application, and then implementing the necessary functionailty (in the right order) was a tough one! I in fact changed my concept at least 3 times before getting started.

The CLI I designed is an app for craft beer enthusiasts who are interested in finding breweries in their home state. Craft beer lovers will travel for miles to tour a brewery or pick up some of theiri favorite beer; including myself!

As to focus solely on the fundamentals I chose not to build a gem, and I utilized the Open Brewery DB API (Application Programming Interface). I used the JSON and HTTParty gems to handle my GET requests and navigate my data.

The user enters their state and is returned a list of 20 breweries in their home state. They can then select a brewery on the list to return detailed information like address, phone number, and website of each individual brewery.

One of the most valuable personal lessons I learned in this project was to - ask for help. The Flatiron team is incredible, knowledgable and their genuine desire to see me fall in love with code the way they have is clear. And it's working! I found this project incredibly satisfying and a really valuable experience seeing all the parts/pieces I've learned the last 7 weeks work together in an application. 

Here's to mod 2!
